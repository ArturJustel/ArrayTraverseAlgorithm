# ArrayTraverseAlgorithm
The following project prints 2d array in clockwise pattern

# Algorithm improvements
At the moment when the algorithm finishes processing the last charater of the 2d array, it still adds the "," and " " to the final answer.
Currently, this problem is fixed with the help of the substring function which removes the unnecessarily part. To make the algorithm better,
we should remove the substring function and adjust the logic in such way that it would be able to detect last character processing.
